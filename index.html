	<h1>httpmock - a network stubbing server</h1>
	<p>httpmock is a node.js server that exposes a REST API for creating network servers that can be used for testing without worrying about instability in the real servers.  Right now, it only allows managing HTTP servers.  Want SMTP or FTP support?  I'd love some help...</p>
	<p>There are client bindings to the REST API that make using httpmock enjoyable in the language you're developing in.  Right now, there's only a JAVA library.  Want C# or Ruby?  I'd love some help...</p>
