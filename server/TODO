* Remove string.format for something more javascript like
* add jslint
* Accept HTML; allow QA's to manually set up tests
* Add HTML pages for the different rel urls
* Allow retrieving stubs per server, deleting some
* Allow ordering stub calls to same path to simulate state change
* Fix or remove merge (maybe just use Object.create?)
** Having to add the || '' in stubServer.js to write the body is sympomatic
* Add endpoint to set defaults for stubs?
* Remove verify, unit Test - use something like what Sino does
* support stubbing by request method!!!
* use better setup/teardowns
